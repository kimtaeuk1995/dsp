[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

> Answer 

```
#first babies
group1_lb = first_babies.totalwgt_lb

#other babies
group2_lb = other_babies.totalwgt_lb

CohenEffectSize(group1_lb, group2_lb)
```

*The effect is bigger than the difference in pregnancy length but still very small*
